The procedures for Working in the UBN Project
=============================================

Here are the detailed procedures that writers should follow in their work. 

1. At the start of work on every day, all note writers should check the various inventories and the reject inventories in order to keep informed about their contents.
2. Make sure you are equipped with enough resources for your research: study Bibles, commentaries, and other helps.
3. At the start of each chapter, insert a chapter number header on its own line, of the form # Acts 1, # Acts 2, etc. See sample note below with side annotations.
4. Proceeding verse by verse in that section, ask the questions that you think alert readers should ask. Write down those questions. Once you have written, remember to leave the questions. Do not erase them.
5. Add a verse number header on its own line as you began writing questions for a new verse. The header format is ### 1, ### 2, etc.
6. Tag each question on its last line with this tag: #q. In this way, a later removal of all questions will be easy to accomplish.
7. Sort the questions into basic and advanced categories. (See section 4.1.)
8. Compose notes that answer the questions that you have generated. Remember to respect the word length: 30 words for basic-level notes and 90 words for advanced-level notes. Some questions will merit both a basic note and an advanced note. In this case, assume that the basic note will always be published with the advanced note. Separate each note by a blank line from the preceding note. Remember that the final publication of the notes will be without questions, so be sure to compose the notes so they can stand alone with no question. In other words, the notes must not seem like answers to questions.
9. Add all tags each on their own lines.
10. You must add a verse number tag of the form #v1, #v2 after each note. If you forget to do this, the note will not appear when you commit the file.
