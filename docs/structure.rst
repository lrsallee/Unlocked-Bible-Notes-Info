The IT Architecture of the UBN Project
======================================

General Architecture
--------------------

- Door43/en-ubn - the UBN home page that contains information pertinent and links to all the other UBN repos
- Door43/en-ubn-articles - the repo that contains the articles that will be linked from both the UBN notes and UBC
- Door43/en-ubn-xxx - each biblical book has its own repo

Specific Architecture
---------------------

Door43/en-ubn 
-----
Homepage of the UBN

1. Location of all files that are for global reference/use

2. Links to all other biblical book repos on the main readme file.

3. The explanation of the UBN project

4. The volunteer job description

5. A link to this present document


Door43/en-ubn-xxx, 
----
(where xxx = three-letter code for any biblical book). 

Here is where to locate the working files for the UBN (i.e., the files containing the notes as they are being composed and edited):

- All writers and manager-revisers will do their work online in one of these repositories. Each biblical book repository will contain the working notes created for that book.
- Each chapter of the book will have its own file. For example: Luke 1 will have the following chapter URL: https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ubn-luk/src/master/content/01.md Â 

So that the directory tree for any book will look like: (Psalms will be 3 digit numbers)Content		01.md		02.md		intro.md

Directory Structure
-------------------




Content
-------

The folder structure of the content directory
Note: that where a .txt extension is shown below, the proper extension should be used according to the content_mime_type indicated in the package.json. For example .usfm or .md.

.. code-block:: none

    en-ubn-luk/
        |-.github
        |-content/
        |    |-01.md
        |    |-02.md
        |    |-intro.md
        |-license
        |-reademe.md
        

The directories shown above indicate chapters except for the two reserved folders `front` and `back` which contain, if applicable, the front matter and back matter of the container.
