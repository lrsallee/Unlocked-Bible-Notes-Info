The tagging Features in the Notes
=================================

The UBN is composed in markdown language, which uses tags beginning with the hashtag (#), also called  the pound sign. In addition to the current inventory of tags for the UBN project, anyone is free to propose more tags. Any manager-reviser will have the authority to accept or reject such requests.

Remark: these tags are sorted into four groups, as presented below. Because it is important for writers and manager-revisers to remember the order of these four groups, we propose the follow mnemonic phrase: "Failure to Sleep Reduces Well-being" -- Filtering, Scripture, Resource, Working. If you do not like this phrase, maybe you will find this one better: “Forgiven Sinners Rise to Worship.”  

Remark: Each tag must go on its own line after a note, with only a few exceptions as noted below

Filtering Tags
---------------

These tags will allow users to find certain kinds of notes. ALL FILTERING TAGS SHOULD BE PLACED AS THE FIRST GROUP OF TAGS AFTER EVERY NOTE.

- Verse number (#vn). (Examples: #v1, #v2-4) Put this tag immediately after every note. Any note lacking this tag will not appear in the database of notes.
- Advanced level note (#adv). This tag marks advanced level notes; basic level notes go untagged for level. See the explanation of advanced level notes in section 4.1 above.
- Biblical theme (#bt-xxx). (Example: #bt-judgment) This tag allows users to locate notes having to do with distinct biblical themes, such as redemption, judgment, heaven, sin, etc. For example, if a writer composes a note on Mark 1:11 ("A voice called from heaven, 'You are my beloved Son; with you I am very pleased'"), he may wish to mark it with the #bt-christ tag. As a result, this note will appear if a user searches for notes relevant to the biblical theme of Christology.
- Theological stance (#ts-xxx). (Example: #ts-infantbap) This tag is used to mark notes that give theological positions that fall outside of WA's Core beliefs. 

These tags are available to attach to notes that present a viewpoint that is not shared by all Christians. Notes favoring theological positions that are not included in WA’s Core beliefs should be tagged in this way so that these notes can be kept from publication for now. They will be reserved for possible publication in the future, in an expanded version of the notes. See https://www.wycliffeassociates.org/who-we-are/our-core-beliefs to find WA’s core beliefs stated. 

Sometimes we may write a note that unconsciously favors a certain theological stance. If a  manager-reviser determines that a note favors a certain theological stance, steps must be taken either to make the note more balanced, or to add the theological stance tag.

On the other hand, if a note presents both sides of a controversy in an even-handed manner (as judged by the manager-reviser), then no theological stance tag should be required.
