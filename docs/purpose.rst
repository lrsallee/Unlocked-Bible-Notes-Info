Purpose of this Document
-----------

The purpose of this document is to present to the UBN writers and editors the philosophy guiding the UBN project, as well as an overview of how the UBN is meant to function in relationship to the Unlocked Bible Commentary (UBC) project. This document also is meant to describe all the working procedures and management structure in the UBN project. Finally, it will present the personnel with the needed information about online repositories and file locations, as well as instructions for working with them.

Purpose of the Unlocked Bible Notes (UBN)
----------------------

The UBN is meant to provide in Christian-resource-deprived languages a set of Bible study notes similar to the many such resources that Western Christians use. Such notes usually serve as brief aids for the Scripture reader’s rapid comprehension of the biblical text. They may refer to very profound themes and subjects requiring further study, but they themselves are meant to interfere minimally with the reader’s Scripture-reading process.

The UBN is meant to be freely translated and adapted into other languages.
